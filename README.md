Three services built with **hexagonal architecture** (ports & adapters):

| Service | Language | Port | Database | Responsibility |
|---------|----------|------|----------|----------------|
| `web-ui` | React 19 + Vite | 80 (nginx) | — | SPA frontend with login, devices CRUD, events, dashboards, settings |
| `go-service` | Go 1.23+ | 8080 | PostgreSQL | Full device CRUD (5 endpoints) + JWT auth + Kafka producer |
| `node-service` | Node.js 22+ | 3000 | MongoDB | Event logging (`POST /events`) + Kafka consumer |

Inter-service communication is **event-driven via Apache Kafka** in KRaft mode (no Zookeeper). The Go service produces three event types — `device.created`, `device.updated`, `device.deleted` — to the `device-events` topic; the Node service consumes all three from it asynchronously.

### Key Architecture Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **Hexagonal architecture** (both services) | Domain logic isolated from infrastructure; testable without DB/HTTP |
| **Kafka KRaft for event-driven communication** | Decouples services; single broker, no Zookeeper; KRaft simplifies ops |
| **Manual dependency injection** | No DI frameworks — explicit wiring in `main.go`/`index.js` |
| **`slog`** for Go logging | Standard library, zero dependencies, structured JSON natively |
| **`pino`** for Node.js logging | Fastest Node.js logger, ideal for microservices |
| **`pgx`** for PostgreSQL driver | Most idiomatic and performant Go PostgreSQL driver |
| **`golang-jwt/jwt/v5`** for JWT | Maintained fork of the standard Go JWT library; HMAC-SHA256 signing |
| **Native test runners** | `go test` (table-driven) + `node:test` — no test frameworks needed |
| **TDD mandatory** for business logic | Red → green → refactor for all domain + application layers |
| **12-Factor App** configuration | All config via environment variables; `.env` only for local dev |
| **JWT Bearer token authentication** | JWT auth on all `/devices` endpoints; `golang-jwt/jwt/v5` library; credentials via env vars (demo scope) |
| **React 19 + Vite** for frontend | Fast dev server with HMR, type-safe routing with TanStack Router |
| **TanStack Query** for server state | Cache invalidation on mutations, stale-while-revalidate, zero reducers |
| **React Context** for auth state | Single token value — no global state library needed |
| **SPA with nginx** | Multi-stage Docker build; nginx serves static assets and proxies API calls |
| **`LoadingSkeleton` grid variant** | Single component handles both row and grid skeletons via `variant` prop — backward-compatible, single source of animation/pulse |
| **Refresh skeleton over inline spinner** | Dual indicators (spinner + skeleton) create cognitive noise; full-grid skeleton is unambiguous, professional feedback |
| **Skeleton cards mirror card container classes** | Identical `rounded-lg border border-slate-700 bg-slate-800 p-5 shadow-sm` classes prevent layout shift during skeleton-to-card transition |
| **"Red Ledger" aesthetic for deleted devices** | Deleted section uses `border-l-rose-600/40` red accent + red-tinted gradient; cards get `opacity-70`, red badge with Trash2, and archived hover feel (`hover:opacity-85`, no scale) — visually distinct from active cards without structural changes |
| **Four-state health classification** | Replaced binary `healthy: boolean` with `status: HealthStatus` — distinguishes offline (network error), unhealthy (HTTP errors), stale (cached), and healthy (green); `classifyHealth()` is a pure function with zero framework deps |
| **Priority-based badge chain** | Single top-bar badge shows worst-case status: Offline > Unhealthy > Stale > none; prevents badge stacking and reduces cognitive load at a glance |
| **TypeError detection with cross-realm fallback** | `instanceof TypeError` OR `error?.message?.includes('fetch')` — safe cross-realm detection for iframe/bundler scenarios where `instanceof` may fail |
| **Ring buffer for request tracing (cap 200)** | In-memory ring buffer per backend avoids allocation per push (pre-allocated slice/array). Mutex (Go) shared-nothing (Node) for thread safety. `count` tracked separately from `len(traces)` since slice stays at cap after first wrap. No external persistence — additive, no migration risk |
| **Settings state via React Context** | Extracted `useSettings` from local `useState` hooks into a shared `SettingsProvider` (same pattern as `AuthContext`). Prevents stale-closure bugs where `SettingsPanel` and `LiveMetrics` held independent state copies — polling interval changes now propagate instantly without page refresh |

## Quick Start

### Full Stack (with Docker Compose)

```bash
docker compose up -d
# Open http://localhost in your browser
# Login with username: admin, password: admin
```

### Frontend Development (standalone Vite dev server)

Requires the backend services running (via `docker compose up -d`):

```bash
cd web-ui
npm install
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser
```

The Vite dev server proxies `/api/go/*` to `localhost:8080` and `/api/node/*` to `localhost:3000`.

### Backend API (curl)

```bash
docker compose up -d
curl localhost:8080/health        # → {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
curl localhost:8080/health/live   # → {"status":"ok"} (liveness)
curl localhost:8080/health/ready  # → {"status":"ok","database":"connected"} (readiness)
curl localhost:8080/metrics       # → {"requests_total":0,"errors_total":0}
curl localhost:3000/health        # → {"status":"ok","database":"connected"}
curl localhost:3000/health/live   # → {"status":"ok"} (liveness)
curl localhost:3000/health/ready  # → {"status":"ok","database":"connected"} (readiness)
curl localhost:3000/metrics       # → {"requests_total":0,"errors_total":0}
curl localhost:8080/metrics/requests?limit=5  # → {"requests_total":0,"errors_total":0,"recent":[...]}
curl localhost:3000/metrics/requests?limit=5  # → {"requests_total":0,"errors_total":0,"recent":[...]}

# Login and get a JWT token (POST/PUT/DELETE /devices require JWT; GET is public)
curl -X POST localhost:8080/auth/login \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"username":"admin","password":"admin"}'

# Create a device (authenticated)
TOKEN="<token-from-login>"
curl -X POST localhost:8080/devices \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name":"laptop","type":"computer"}'

# List all devices
curl localhost:8080/devices

# Log an event
curl -X POST localhost:3000/events \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"type":"device.created","deviceId":"550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000","name":"laptop"}'

# Query events by device ID
curl "localhost:3000/events?deviceId=550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000"

# Query events by type (e.g., view deleted devices)
curl "localhost:3000/events?type=device.deleted"

# Verify Kafka events (after CRUD operations)
docker compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh \
  --bootstrap-server kafka:9092 --topic device-events --from-beginning --max-messages 3

# Verify events in MongoDB
docker compose exec mongo mongosh -u mongo -p changeme --authenticationDatabase admin \
  --eval "use asset_tracker; db.events.find().pretty()"
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Go service
cd go-service && go test ./...

# Node.js service
cd node-service && node --test

# Frontend (unit + integration)
cd web-ui && npm test

# Frontend (E2E — requires backend running)
cd web-ui && npx playwright test
```

## Seed Script

Reset and populate databases with demo data:

```bash
# Prerequisites: services running via `docker compose up -d`
./seed.sh
```

The script performs:

1. **Cleans** PostgreSQL (`DELETE FROM devices`) and MongoDB (`db.events.deleteMany({})`)
2. **Logs in** to obtain a JWT token
3. **Creates** 10 devices across 6 types (server, network, laptop, tablet, phone, storage, iot)
4. **Logs** 160 manual events (~16 per device) with realistic types, actors, and descriptions
5. **Deletes** 3 devices (Cisco Catalyst 9300, iPad Pro 12.9, Raspberry Pi 5) — they remain visible in the Deleted Devices section via `device.deleted` events

Output:

```
✅ 10 devices created
✅ 160 events logged
🗑️  3 devices deleted
```

Tests run automatically on every push via [GitHub Actions](.github/workflows/ci.yml).
