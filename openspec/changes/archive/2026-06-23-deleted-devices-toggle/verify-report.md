## Post-Archive Fix: Bug 1 (Unknown type) & Bug 2 (Device not found)

**Date**: 2026-06-23
**Commit**: `fix(web-ui): show deleted device info in modal instead of 404, fix 'Unknown' type`

### Bug 1 — Type shows "Unknown"

**Root cause**: `mapEventToDevice` in `DeletedDevicesList.tsx` hardcoded `type: "Unknown"` because MongoDB events don't store the device type.

**Fix**: Changed hardcoded type from `"Unknown"` to `"Deleted"` — semantically correct and informative.

### Bug 2 — Details shows "Device not found"

**Root cause**: The Details button on deleted device cards navigated to `/devices/$id`, which hits the PostgreSQL API. Since the device was hard-deleted, `GET /devices/$id` returns 404.

**Fix**: Added optional `onDetails` prop to `DeviceGridCard`. When provided, it's called instead of navigating. `DeletedDevicesList` passes `onDetails` that opens a Modal with the event data (name, device ID, deletion timestamp, optional actor/description).

### Files Changed
| File | Action | What Was Done |
|------|--------|---------------|
| `web-ui/src/components/devices/DeviceGridCard.tsx` | Modified | Added optional `onDetails` prop; conditional handler checks `onDetails` before navigating |
| `web-ui/src/components/devices/DeletedDevicesList.tsx` | Modified | Changed `type: "Unknown"` → `"Deleted"`; added `onDetails` + Modal with event info |
| `web-ui/src/components/devices/__tests__/DeviceGridCard.test.tsx` | Modified | Added 2 tests: `onDetails` callback behavior, navigation fallback |
| `web-ui/src/components/devices/__tests__/DeletedDevicesList.test.tsx` | Modified | Added 1 test: modal opens with event details on Details click |

### Verification
| Check | Result |
|-------|--------|
| TypeScript | ✅ `tsc --noEmit` clean |
| Unit tests | ✅ 325/327 passed (2 pre-existing timeouts unchanged) |

## Post-Verify Fix — Event timeline in deleted device modal

**Problem**: Deleted device detail modal only showed basic info (name, ID, date). User wanted the full event timeline.

**Fix**:
- Added `isError` and `onRetry` optional props to `EventTimeline` component
- In `DeletedDevicesList`, added `useEvents(deviceId)` hook call
- Modal now renders `<EventTimeline>` below basic info, with loading/error/empty/data states
- Added `max-h-[60vh] overflow-y-auto` for scroll on long timelines
- 5 new tests covering all timeline states

**Files**: `EventTimeline.tsx`, `DeletedDevicesList.tsx`, `DeletedDevicesList.test.tsx`
**Tests**: 332/332 passed
**Commit**: `993f692`
